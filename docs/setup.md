# Setup development environment

Python Development

Use PyCharm and Poetry

Install pipx (https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

brew update && brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
sudo pipx ensure-path --global # optional to allow pipx actions with --global argument
pipx install argcomplete
pipx completions
autoload -U compinit && compinit


# Make sure ~/.local/bin is in front of your path in .zshrc:
export PATH="/Users/jeroen_manders/.local/bin:$PATH"
# Add the following to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pipx)"


pipx install poetry
mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/poetry
poetry completions zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/poetry/_poetry


You must then add poetry to your plugins array in ~/.zshrc:


plugins(
	poetry
	...
	)

## Use Black as the formatter

Add the following to pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py37']
include = '\.pyi?$'
# 'extend-exclude' excludes files or directories in addition to the defaults
extend-exclude = '''
# A regex preceded with ^/ will apply only to files and directories
# in the root of the project.
(
  ^/foo.py    # exclude a file named foo.py in the root of the project
  | .*_pb2.py  # exclude autogenerated Protocol Buffer files anywhere in the project
)
'''
```

- Open Settings -> Tools -> Black and install the Black package
